## cal-ics

A fullcalendar tool to add ICS urls as datasources.

Full credit for the implementation goes to [https://github.com/leonaard/icalendar2fullcalendar](https://github.com/leonaard/icalendar2fullcalendar).

This is just an attempt to package the code into a module to use with Svelte. The goal of this would be to include ICAL.js as well but modular support of that in JS is still in development.
